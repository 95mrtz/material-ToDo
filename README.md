# Material ToDo

This project was created using the React JS library and Material UI

The functionality consists of being able to enter a task, being able to mark it as a completed task, delete it and unmark it so that it returns to the list of tasks to be completed

To create this project I use:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
- [Vercel for deploy](https://vercel.com/)
